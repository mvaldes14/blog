I know this will sound weird specially coming from someone that lives and spends 70% of my time living in a terminal and using neovim btw but sometimes it's really ok to not use the hot and cool tool that people tell you to use.

Granted it's a great editor and ecosystem and it will make you blazingly fast by just getting the hang of vim motions but the more I keep reading on discords channels and subreddits, people are jumping into the ecosystem by copying what they see in the internet and when __neovim or the plugins get an update and hell breaks loose which happens pretty often they are completely clueless on what to do or have zero interest in learning how to fix it which goes against the entire reason why people like us tinkerers go into using it in the first place!__

Sometimes it is ok to just have vim motions in other editors like VSCode or Zed, you don't really have to use the hot tool if you are not going to spend time into learning what it is and how it works. 

If you really want to join in and fully commit to this cult, cause yeah sometimes it has a cult like behavior... probably the reason why you are trying it in the first place... then please come on in, we have cookies and a bunch of lua for you to enjoy and also there are great creators out there preaching the gospel and showing you how it works and why you should use it.

Some of my favorite resources are:

The community on it's own is pretty good at helping people out but my brother in neovim you also have to use your head a little and when the message is something redundant like....

```bash
Option X has been deprecated, please remove it from your config
```

or
```bash
New version requires a depepdency on plugin 'author/plugin-name' please include it in your configuration
```

You gotta read a bit and try some stuff on your own. 

> If you haven't cared enough to try on your own why should I?

This is in general an __AWESOME skill to have as an engineer, be resourceful, don't be afraid to try and fail__.  If you truly did best effort it's still broken then by all means ask away, but seriously don't just ask or inquire if you haven't done the minimal effort of even trying.  It's something I always teach new people I train on my teams throughout my career, basic troubleshooting skills which may come out as an asshole move but trust me down the road they all thank me.

So please come join us but be ready to try and succeed!
