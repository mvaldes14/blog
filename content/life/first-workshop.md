Part of my resolutions for this year is to do more public speaking so I've been looking for oportunities to do so at local meetups, company conferences or anything basically.

So the first oportunity arrived in 2025 when a fellow Latino content-creator [Try-Catch](https://trycatch.tv/) (who you should check out btw), offered a space within his community to provide a workshop related to DevOps which is what I mostly work on so here it is!.

**NOTE**: It is in spanish cause if you didn't know... I'm Mexican.

This is hopefully the first of many down the road!.
