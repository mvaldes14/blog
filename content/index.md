Welcome to my Personal Site! Here, I will share my experiences as I work on various projects or learn new skills, often inspired by what catches my interest. Most of the time, it's just me exploring exciting and cool topics or tools.

If it's terminal, observability or automation related you will most likely see me try it here. Sometimes I will also write about games or my experience in the field.
### A bit about myself: 
My name is Miguel, born in Mexico, and I am an Electronic Engineer by profession who found a deep passion for software. The love affair with computers began when my parents brought home a PC during the era of Jill of the Jungle. Needless to say, I was on a journey from an early age. Fortunately, I enjoy what I do for a living and am captivated by the IT world as a whole.

I'm a video game enthusiast, with preferences for First-Person Shooters (FPS), Hack & Slash games, and of course Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs). Some of my favorite titles are Diablo II and DoTA.

### How can I reach you?
My social media info can be found at the bottom of each page.
I'm pretty active on X so your best bet is to send me a DM over there. I also have a discord server which mostly receives messages from my Homelab when events occur within my cluster/home.
