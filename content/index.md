**Hello, Hola!**

This is more than just a blogâ€”it's a workshop for the curious and a log of my journey through the ever-evolving world of software engineering. I believe in the power of automation, the elegance of clean code, and the satisfaction of owning your own data. Join me as I explore the latest in DevOps tooling, share what I've learned from my self-hosting projects, and dive into the architecture behind the software we use every day. Let's grow our skills together.

If you found this post helpful, there's more where that came from. Follow me on [X](https://x.com/mr_mvaldes) for quick tips, new project updates, and more behind-the-scenes content. I'd love to connect and hear your thoughts.
