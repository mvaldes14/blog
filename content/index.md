**Hello, Hola!**

This is more than just a blog, it’s a workshop for the curious and a log of my journey through the ever-evolving world of software engineering. I believe in the power of automation, the elegance of clean code, and the satisfaction of owning your own data.

Join me as I explore the latest in DevOps tooling, share what I’ve learned from my self-hosting projects, and dive into the architecture behind the software we use every day. Let’s grow our skills together.

Follow me on [X](https://x.com/mr_mvaldes) for quick tips, new project updates, and more behind-the-scenes content. I’d love to connect and hear your thoughts.
