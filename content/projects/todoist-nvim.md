You might think this guy works mostly on his productivity tools instead of actually working/shipping things, and you will be 100% correct. It is a nasty habit of mine of trying to improve my workflows non-stop, which leaves zero time or energy for actually working… the irony of life, am I right?

That being said, I have been working on yet another neovim plugin, another addiction of mine tweaking and making Neovim work for me so it can integrate into said workflows or tools. This time I’ve developed a plugin to integrate with Todoist—I’ve been a user for years and I seriously vouch and use it every single day to dump things out of my brain easily; now getting those tasks done is another story.

Either way, the plugin right now has 2 main features with an extra added feature I’m still thinking about.
1. Help me get tasks out of my brain quickly by simply adding a todo
2. Visualize all of the tasks in my queue
3. Find and search for tasks
